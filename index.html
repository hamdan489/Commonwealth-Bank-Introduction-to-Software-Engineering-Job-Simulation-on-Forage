    <body><h1>Tips to Improve Financial Cybersecurity</h1>
    
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Exercise Caution with Links and Emails</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources, especially in unsolicited emails.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Instead, directly access your financial institution's website or app to verify any communications.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <p><strong>Use Strong and Unique Passwords</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Create long passwords with a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Avoid using common phrases or easily guessable information.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Use different passwords for each account to minimize risk if one password is compromised.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Browse Carefully</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Ensure you are on a secure website when accessing your financial accounts online. Look for a web address that starts with "https" and has a key or closed padlock icon in the browser's status bar.</p></li>
                <li><p>Avoid multitasking on multiple webpages while logged into your accounts. If you need to visit another site, use a different browser to reduce the risk of "session stealing."</p></li>
                <li><p>Always click the "log out" button to properly terminate access to your financial account. Simply closing the browser or typing a new web address may allow others to re-enter and access your account.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    
            <li>
                <p><strong>Enable Multifactor Authentication (MFA)</strong></p>
                <p>Opt for multifactor authentication where available, requiring an additional verification step (e.g., SMS code) along with your password.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <p><strong>Maintain Device Security</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Install and regularly update security software, including antivirus and antispyware programs.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Keep your operating system and software up to date with automatic updates.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Consider using encryption and secure connections when accessing financial accounts.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Use Your Own Device.</strong> </p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Avoid using public computers or unfamiliar devices to access financial accounts due to potential security risks.</p></li>
                <li><p>Public computers may have malicious software that can capture passwords and PINs, compromising your account security.</p></li>
                <li><p>If you must use another computer, remember to clear your browsing history, cache, and temporary internet files after logging out.</p></li>
                <li><p>Use strong passwords, passphrases, or biometric authentication to protect your mobile devices and any financial apps you use.</p></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
            
            <li>
                <p><strong>Use Secure Networks</strong></p>
                <p>Avoid using public Wi-Fi for financial transactions. Use a trusted, encrypted network or a VPN (Virtual Private Network) for added security.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <p><strong>Verify Websites and Companies</strong></p>
                <p>Research companies and websites before sharing personal information or making transactions. Look for HTTPS in the web address to ensure encryption is used for data transmission.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <p><strong>Be Mindful of Personal Information</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Treat personal information like cash. Share it only when necessary and with trusted entities.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Be cautious of phishing attempts and fraudulent requests for personal information.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <p><strong>Regularly Review Account Activity</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Monitor your financial accounts regularly for unauthorized transactions or changes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Review monthly statements promptly and report any discrepancies to your financial institution.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <p><strong>Back Up Important Data</strong></p>
                <p>Regularly back up important financial data on secure, offline storage to protect against data loss.</p>
